Systems Programmer (UW PVL# 75373)
==================================


The Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG) is
leading the development of a novel open-source agent-based platform
for the simulation of advanced nuclear fuel cycles, Cyclus
(cyclus.github.com). The core infrastructure of this effort combines
concepts from operations research, computer science and nuclear
engineering to provide a lexible basis for studying the tecehnical and
socioeconomic impacts of different nuclear fuel cycle choices.

CNERG is seeking a qualified individual to assist in the development
of a robust software platform and the generation of an open source
community of user/developers.
