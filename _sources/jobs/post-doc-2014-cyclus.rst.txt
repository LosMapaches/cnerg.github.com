Post-Doctoral Associate Opportunity (2014): Agent-based Fuel Cycle Optimization
================================================================================

*[Updated: March 25, 2014]*

The Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG) is
leading the development of a novel open-source agent-based platform
for the simulation of advanced nuclear fuel cycles, Cyclus
(http://fuelcycle.org).  The core infrastructure of this effort combines
concepts from operations research, computer science and nuclear
engineering to provide a flexible basis for studying the technical
and socioeconomic impacts of different nuclear fuel cycle choices.

A particular focus of the Cyclus project for the next few years is to create
market and economic optimizers to improve calculations for the CYCLUS fuel
cycle simulator. The team will leverage existing optimization software
frameworks within the simulator to resolve top level policy questions. The
optimizations will allow CYCLUS to increase the physical fidelity of the models 
(moving well beyond static material compositions) while simultaneously
providing a holistic view of the fuel cycle system.

CNERG is seeking a qualified individual to assist in the development of
optimization methodologies for agent-based fuel cycle simulation as part of an
open source community of user/developers.
