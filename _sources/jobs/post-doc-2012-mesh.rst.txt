Post-Doctoral Associate Opportunity (2012): Geometry & Mesh for Radiation Transport and Multi-Physics Simulation
================================================================================================================

The Computational Nuclear Engineering Reasearch Group (CNERG) is
working on a number of projects related to the the advanced use of
geometry and mesh technology to support nuclear simulation, including
coupled multi-physics simulation and Monte Carlo radiation transport.

The DataTransferKit_ is an open-source component library providing
scalable algorithms for transferring and synchronizing solutions
between different physics solvers in massively parallel multi-physics
simulations.  As part of the `Consortium for Advanced Simulation of
LWR (CASL) <http://www.casl.gov>`_, CNERG is responsible for providing
this fundamental capability and related improvements to measure and
ensure conservation and to support uncertainty quantification.

The Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo (DAGMC) toolkit is an
open-source toolkit that enables the use of complex CAD-based geometry
in Monte Carlo radiation transport simulation.  Ongoing research and
development efforts are focused on 

 * alternative tessellation and surface mesh methods for robustness
   and performance improvement 
 * advanced tallies on unstructured mesh
   including expansion methods and kernel density estimators 

This work involves close collaboration with the Fathom team based at
Argonne National Laboratory and the CASL team based at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory.

CNERG is seeking a qualified individual to assist in the research and
development needs of these exciting projects.
