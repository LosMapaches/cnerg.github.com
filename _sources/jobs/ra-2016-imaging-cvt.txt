Research Assistant Opportunity (2016): Synthetic Image Generation for Nuclear Non-proliferation
==================================================================================================

*[Updated: March 31, 2016]*

The Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG) at UW Madison is
currently working at the interface of international security policy and nuclear
engineering on issues related to treaty verification for fissile material
production, such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty or a potential Fissile Material
Cutoff Treaty.  We have developed the `Cyclus fuel cycle simulator
<http://fuelcycle.org>`_  to model current and next-generation nuclear fuel
cycles as part of the `Consortium for Verification Technology
<http://cvt.engin.umich.edu/>`_. |Cyclus| is an agent-based, systems-level
simulator that tracks discrete material flow through the entire fuel cycle,
from mining through burnup in reactors to a repository.  

We seek a research assistant to develop synthetic satellite images of nuclear
facilities for monitoring and verification.  Satellite images can provide
information on material shipments, production and maintenance staffing, physical
and environmental impact, etc.  Synthetic images will be designed with 
changeable features at different times that are correlated with other fuel 
cycle signals.  These images will be used in Cyclus to study the clandestine 
material diversion from declared fuel cycles.  Due to funding restrictions, 
only US citizens can be considered.

Experience
----------

* Masters or PhD student in Nuclear Engineering, Computer Science, Physics,
  Math, Astronomy, Atmospheric Science, Geography or related field
* Interest in international security and nuclear non-proliferation OR
* Experience with image processing and analysis
* Some programming experience desired


Specific Duties
---------------

* Research appropriate parameters and specifications to make simplified but
  representative fake satellite images (resolution, image size, variety of
  information)
* Define the properties of relevant image features (such as truck shape/size,
  etc)
* Write a program in Python that uses a table of features and positions to
  create fake images. Program will be flexible/extensible for additional
  features in the future.

To be considered for a Research Assistant position (50% plus tuition
remission), please send a letter of interest, resume, and unofficial
transcript to Paul Wilson or Meghan McGarry at cnerg-cvt _at_ lists.wisc.edu
