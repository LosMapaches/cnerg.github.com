Project/Research Assistant Opportunity (2015): Social-Behavioral Modeling of Nuclear Proliferation
==================================================================================================

*[Updated: August 21, 2015]*

The Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG) at UW Madison is
currently working at the interface of international security policy and
nuclear engineering on issues related to treaty verification for fissile
material production, such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty or a potential
Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty.  We have developed the `Cyclus fuel cycle
simulator <http://fuelcycle.org>`_ to model current and next-generation
nuclear fuel cycles as part of the `Consortium for Verification Technology
<http://cvt.engin.umich.edu/>`_.  |Cyclus| is an agent-based, systems-level
simulator that tracks discrete material flow through the entire fuel cycle,
from mining through burnup in reactors to a repository.

We seek a graduate assistant to combine their interest in social/behavioral
models of international relations, particularly in the context of nuclear
proliferation, with our nuclear engineering expertise to develop
social-behavior models of individual actors in the fuel cycle. This model will
be used in Cyclus to study the clandestine material diversion from declared
fuel cycles.  Due to funding restrictions, only US citizens can be considered.

Experience
----------

* Masters or PhD student in Political Science, Public Policy, Psychology or
  related field
* Interest in international security, nuclear non-proliferation, game theory
  and/or risk perception, OR
* Experience with social-behavioral modeling, such as game theory, Bayes nets,
  network science models
* No programming experience required, but willingness to learn is a plus

Specific Duties
---------------

* Develop a quantitative framework to describe the likelihood of covert
  nuclear material diversion, at individual or regional levels.
* Analyze simulation results to compare relative proliferation risk with
  different types of behavior or fuel cycle structure.
  
To be considered for an hourly Project Assistant position (33% plus tuition
