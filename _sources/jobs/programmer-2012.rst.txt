Systems Programmer (UW PVL# 74230)
==================================

The Computational Nuclear Engineering Reasearch Group (CNERG) is
actively developing a software library to enable the direct analysis
of CAD-based geometry in Monte Carlo radiation transport: Direct
Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo (DAGMC). This base library is
distributed as part of an open source development effort, while
interface code for a handful of specific Monte Carlo (MC) physics
engines is distributed separately or integrated in those codesâ€™
distributions.

CNERG is seeking an experienced programmer/software developer to:

* manage the ongoing development of DAGMC (bug fixes, feature enhancement, performance improvement),
* lead its integration into a growing set of Monte Carlo physics codes, and
* support the development of tools/workflows based on DAGMC.
