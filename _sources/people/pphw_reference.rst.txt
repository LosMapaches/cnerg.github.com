.. title Getting a reference

Requesting a Reference or Recommendation from Paul Wilson
=========================================================

Background
----------

I am often asked to write reference or recommendation letters, or
otherwise act as a reference, for current and former students, whether
for employment, fellowships/scholarships, or graduate school
admission.  Since it is in your best interest to receive the best
possible recommendation or reference, I have prepared these guidelines
to help optimize the process.

The first section helps you decide if I am the right person to provide this
reference.  If you have already decided this and/or I have already agreed, you
can jump to the next section.

Choosing the Right Person
-------------------------

The very first question is whether or not I am the best person to
write you the reference you want.  If you think so, in your request
for me to provide a recommendation, please write me a brief paragraph
explaining why.  Please include the following information, at a
minimum:

 * how long I have known you
 * in what capacity/capacities I have known you
 * if I have been a course instructor
     *   which courses and semesters
     *   what was the topic of any projects you did in the class
 * if I know you through the UW-ANS
     *   when and in what capacity were you involved in ANS

From this information, you should then be able to also give me a clear
picture of why I am the best person to write a compelling letter in
support of your application.  Based on some of the information below,
indicate which of your qualities I am best able to highlight to
support your application.

The strongest recommendations are possible only for people I have
interacted with closely in some capacity beyond simply being a course
instructor.

Why are you the right person for this opportunity
-------------------------------------------------

For each opportunity in which you would like me to act as a reference,
please provide information about why you are the right/best person to
fill that opportunity.  This would include:

 * description of opportunity, such as:
     * job description/position listing
     * graduate program description
     * scholarship/fellowship qualifications
 * resume or CV
 * other supporting parts of your applications, for example:
     * cover letter highlighting which of your accomplishments and
       experiences qualifies you for a job
     * personal statement and/or research plan for a grad school or
       fellowship applications
