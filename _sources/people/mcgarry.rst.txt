Meghan McGarry is a research scientist in the CNERG group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Engineering Physics department.  She received her BA in Physics and Astronomy from UC Berkeley, and her PhD in experimental plasma physics from University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Her current research involves using the |Cyclus| nuclear fuel cycle simulator to study nuclear non-proliferation and treaty verification issues as part of the Consortium for Verification Technology. Meghan is interested in many aspects of international security, energy, and the interface between science and policy.  She has attended two Summer Symposia on International Security and World Affairs, hosted by the Union of Concerned Scientists, where she presented research on the potential for high-powered microwave devices to be used as anti-satellite weapons.  Previously, Meghan was a postdoc in plasma physics, where she optimized a soft x-ray tomography and double-filter diagnostic.  She also spent three years working for the Chandra X-ray Observatory at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
