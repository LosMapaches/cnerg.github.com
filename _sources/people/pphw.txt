Paul Wilson is a Professor of Nuclear Engineering in the
`University of Wisconsin-Madison <http://www.wisc.edu>`_'s `Department
of Engineering Physics <http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ep>`_, and Faculty
Director of the `Advanced Computing Initiative <http://aci.wisc.edu>`_.  
His research interests
bring together technical and policy issues: analysis methods of
isotopic inventories in nuclear systems and the implications on
nuclear non-proliferation policy, and the development of next
generation nuclear power systems to fulfill a role in future energy
policy and needs. Paul joined the University of Wisconsin-Madison as
an assistant professor in August 2001 as part of the `Energy Systems
and Policy Hiring Initiative
<http://www.clusters.wisc.edu/clusters/show/18>`_.  Paul currently 
serves on the Program Committee (Interim Chair) of the `Energy Analysis and Policy Graduate Certificate <http://nelson.wisc.edu/eap>`_ , the Executive Committee of the `Wisconsin Energy Institute <http://www.energy.wisc.edu>`_ and the Steering Committee of the `Holtz Center for Science and
Technology Studies <http://sts.wisc.edu>`_, and the Governance Committee of the
`Nelson Institute <http://nelson.wisc.edu>`_ for Environmental Studies.

In addition to the research pursued by his `Computational Nuclear Engineering
Research Group (CNERG) <http://cnerg.engr.wisc.edu>`_, Paul has served in a
number of advisory and consultant roles.  From 2001-2003, he was a member of
the U.S. Department of Energy's Generation IV Technology Roadmap Committee.
In 2010, he was engaged as a consultant to the CEA Saclay, ERC Petten, the
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and the `Blue Ribbon Commission on America's
Nuclear Energy Future <http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/04/f0/brc_finalreport_jan2012.pdf>`_.

Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and raised in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta,
Canada, Paul specialized in the Nuclear Power option of the
`Engineering Science program <http://engsci.utoronto.ca/>`_ at the
`University of Toronto <http://www.utoronto.ca/>`_.  After receiving
his Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering Science, he began his
graduate schooling in nuclear engineering at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison.  After three years, he moved to Karlsruhe, Germany,
where he studied in the Institute for Neutron Physics and Reactor
Engineering (of the `Karlsruhe Institute of Technology <http://www.kit.edu>`_), 
earning his Dr.-Ing. degree in Mechanical Engineering
in 1998.  Returning to Madison, Paul completed his Ph.D. in Nuclear
Engineering in 1999.

Paul was the founding President of the `North American Young
Generation in Nuclear [NA-YGN] <http://www.na-ygn.org>`_, an
organization created to provide unique opportunities to young
professionals in all fields of nuclear science & technology. Paul has
been active in the `American Nuclear Society <http://www.ans.org>`_
for over 15 years, including membership in various committees and
chairing the Student Sections Committee and the Special Committee on
Electronic Communications and Publications.  Paul also represented the
ANS and NA-YGN at the `international climate change negotiations
<http://unfccc.int/>`_ in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1998), and Bonn,
Germany (1999). He is a member of the American and Canadian Nuclear
Societies, the American Society for Engineering Education and the
NA-YGN.

Paul is married and has two daughters.  They enjoy biking around
Madison's paths and spending time outside.

Research Interests
------------------

In leading the `CNERG Home <http://cnerg.engr.wisc.edu>`_
Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group, I am interested in
applying modern computational science practices to answer real-world
and/or policy-driven questions in nuclear engineering.  There are
three primary facets to this work:

* We address real-world questions by helping scientists and engineers
  calculate more accurate radiation transport results on more exact
  representations of their problem and more easily combine those
  results with other analyses.
* We address policy-driven questions by providing simulation
  platforms for realistic scenario analysis in the global deployment
  of advanced nuclear fuel cycles, including provisions for
  approximating non-technical perturbations to those scenarios.
* We invoke modern computational science practices including adoption
  of software management tools and techniques, reliance on third
  party software libraries, and preferring open software solutions.

Teaching
--------

My primary teaching responsibilities are aligned with the research
interests of CNERG:

* `NE 406. Nuclear Reactor Analysis
  <http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ep/neep/courses/neep406.html>`_ - uses
  industry-relevant software to develop deeper intuition of reactor
  physics through virtual laboratory projects
* `NE 506. Practicum in Monte Carlo Radiation Transport
  <http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ep/neep/courses/neep506.html>`_ - teaches
  the fundamentals of Monte Carlo radiation transport and then
  explores their implementation in the widely used `MCNP
  <http://mcnp.lanl.gov>`_ software
* `NE 571. Economic and Environmental Aspects of Nuclear Energy
  <http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ep/neep/courses/neep571.html>`_ - after a
  module in basic engineering economics, explores the economic,
  political and environmental aspects of nuclear energy in the past
  and in the future
* NE 555. Nuclear Reactor Dynamics

I have also recently joined the faculty team who teach
`InterEng 102. Introduction to Society's Engineering Grand Challenges
<http://www.engr.wisc.edu/interegr/courses/interegr102.html>`_.  This
course introduces first year students to the role of engineering in
society's grand challenges through case studies and team projects.

Outreach
--------

Outreach is an important part of the work I do, informing a wide
variety of people, from school children to neighbors to policy-makers,
about the state of nuclear energy, past, present and future.

Other
-----

You can find me most Friday mornings at Mickie's Dairy Bar where I
have been attending for roughly 18 years with a group of nuclear
engineering students and faculty.  We now keep a `kitty
<http://bit.ly/mickies-kitty>`_ of surplus funds for use on special
occasions.
