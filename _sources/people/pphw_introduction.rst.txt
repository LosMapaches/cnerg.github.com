Paul Wilson is the Grainger Professor of Nuclear Engineering in the
`University of Wisconsin-Madison <http://www.wisc.edu>`_'s `Department of
Engineering Physics <http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ep>`_, and Faculty Director of
the `Advanced Computing Initiative <http://aci.wisc.edu>`_.  His research
interests focus on developing improved tools for computational modeling of
complex nuclear energy systems, with applications in radiation shielding,
nuclear waste management, nuclear non-proliferation and energy policy.  Hired
as part of the `Energy Systems and Policy Hiring Initiative
<http://www.clusters.wisc.edu/clusters/show/18>`_, he serves on leadership
committees for the `Energy Analysis and Policy Graduate Certificate
<http://nelson.wisc.edu/eap>`_, the `Wisconsin Energy Institute
<http://www.energy.wisc.edu>`_ and the `Nelson Institute
<http://nelson.wisc.edu>`_ for Environmental Studies.  In 2010, he was engaged
as a consultant to the `Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Energy
Future
<http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/04/f0/brc_finalreport_jan2012.pdf>`_.
In 1998 & 1999, he represented the American Nuclear Society at the
`international climate change negotiations <http://unfccc.int/>`_ in Buenos
Aires, Argentina, and Bonn, Germany.

Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and raised in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada,
Paul received a B.A.Sc. in `Engineering Science program
<http://engsci.utoronto.ca/>`_ at the `University of Toronto
<http://www.utoronto.ca/>`_ in 1992. After three years of graduate school at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he moved to Karlsruhe, Germany, where he
studied in the Institute for Neutron Physics and Reactor Engineering (of the
`Karlsruhe Institute of Technology <http://www.kit.edu>`_), earning his
Dr.-Ing. degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1998.  Returning to Madison, Paul
completed his Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering in 1999.

Paul is married and has two daughters.  They enjoy biking around
Madison's paths and spending time outside.
