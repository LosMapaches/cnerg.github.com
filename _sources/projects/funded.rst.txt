Funded Projects
'''''''''''''''

**ITER First Wall & Shield Analysis:** We collaborate with Sandia National
Laboratories to perform the engineering design of the first wall and
shield modules for the ITER project under construction in France.
This project relies heavily on our DAGMC technology for CAD-based
Monte Carlo radiation transport analysis.

**Advanced Mesh Tallies for Monte Carlo Transport:** Under this 2009 NEUP
R&D project, we are investigating the use of alternative mesh tallies
to extend the capabilities of Monte Carlo modeling of nuclear systems.
A combination of unstructured mesh and alternative estimators should
allow for more variation in mesh resolution and possible adaptivity in
the mesh definition without loss of solution accuracy.  Another
potential benefit is the simplicity of coupling with other physics.

**Predictive Capability for the Design of Near Term Fusion Devices:** In
collaboration with the Fusion Technology Institute and their ongoing
neutronics support of near term fusion devices, we are extending the
predictive analysis capability.  Based on our DAGMC technology, we are
exploring complete workflows for shutdown dose analysis and hybrid
accelerations of the Monte Carlo simulations.

**Multi-physics Solution Transfer on Large Distributed Mesh:** With
funding from the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of LWRs (CASL), we
are developing an open source software component for managing the
transfer of solutions among different multi-physics mesh for massively
parallel simulations.

**Improving the User Experience for Fuel Cycle Simulators:** This 2011
NEUP R&D project is focused on improving the user experience of the
Next Generation Fuel Cycle Simulator. In collaboration with
communication scientists, with expertise in communicating
controversial science, and computer scientists with expertise in visualization
and data investigation.

**Modeling of Nuclear Material Diversion and Proliferation Issues:**  As part
of the `Consortium for Verification Technology <http://cvt.engin.umich.edu/>`_,
|Cyclus| is being used to study issues in
:doc:`nuclear security and non-proliferation <cvt>`.  Research areas include
the incorporation of social-behavioral models to agent interactions, nuclear
material tracking and forensics, and detector sensitivity estimation.
