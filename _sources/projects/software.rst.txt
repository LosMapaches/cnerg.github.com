Software Distribution
=======================

One of the missions of CNERG is to publish software for the analysis of nuclear systems.

* `Svalinn <http://github.com/svalinn>`_ is a collection of tools
  based around the Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo toolkit.

  * `Direct Acclerated Geometry Monte Carlo (DAGMC)
    <http://svalinn.github.com/DAGMC>`_ is a toolkit for perfomring
    efficient Monte Carlo geometry queries on CAD-based geometries.
  * `ATR NSUF Experiment Design Toolkit
    <http://svalinn.github.com/ATR-NSUF-Analysis-Toolkit>`_ is an
    analysis workflow, based on the DAGMC toolkit, to facilitate rapid
    design iterations for ATR NSUF experiments.

* `Cyclus <http://cyclus.github.com>`_ is an open-source agent-based
  platform for analyzing nuclear fuel cycles.
* `DataTransferKit <http://ornl-cees.github.io/DataTransferKit>`_
  provides parallel mesh searching and field mapping services for
  arbitrary physics codes based on the concept of geometric
  rendezevous.
